# Dev Quick Start Guide
{: .no_toc }

This document describes how to quickly get a runtime server built with `sample_lib` library, train a model with gRPC and with that trained model, send an inference call to the server with either HTTP or gRPC call.

## Pre-reqs
To set up development environment and tooling, the [Development Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/developing.md %}) page is a good place to start.

## Start Guide

See https://github.com/caikit/caikit/blob/main/examples/sample_lib/README.md for step by step details on how to get running with a `sample_lib` server and interacting with it.
