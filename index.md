# What is Caikit
{: .no_toc }

Caikit is an AI toolkit that enables you to use and manage AI models through a set of developer-friendly APIs. It provides a consistent format for creating and using AI models across a wide variety of data domains and tasks. Similar to how, in cloud computing, users can deploy applications to the cloud without a detailed understanding of the underlying infrastructure, Caikit handles many of the infrastrucutre concerns of serving and using AI models. With Caikit, developers who write applications that use AI models aren't beholden to understanding the low-level details of how those models work.

Caikit's purpose is twofold:

* It simplifies AI model use, so you can tap into models through familiar APIs (for example, Inference) with no need to transform data.
* It facilitates AI model management by making it easier to train and maintain your models.

Simply put, Caikit makes it easy for you to implement and manage AI models in your apps, so you can focus on new development instead of maintenance.
